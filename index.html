<!-- Build a game of battling alien spaceships using Javascript.
Earth has been attacked by a horde of aliens! You are the captain of the USS HelloWorld, on a mission to destroy every last alien ship.
Battle the aliens as you try to destroy them with your lasers.
There are six alien ships. The aliens' weakness is that they are too logical and attack one at a time: they will wait to see the outcome of a battle before deploying another alien ship. Your strength is that you have the initiative and get to attack first. However, you do not have targeting lasers and can only attack the aliens in order. After you have destroyed a ship, you have the option to make a hasty retreat.
A game round would look like this:
You attack the first alien ship
If the ship survives, it attacks you
If you survive, you attack the ship again
If it survives, it attacks you again â€¦ etc
If you destroy the ship, you have the option to attack the next ship or to retreat
If you retreat, the game is over, perhaps leaving the game open for further developments or options
You win the game if you destroy all of the aliens
You lose the game if you are destroyed -->
